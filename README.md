# Data source:
The Global Air Quality and Respiratory Health outcomes are a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. The data was aggregated, curated and made available on Kaggle by Rishi R Carloni. It contains the AQI metrics of 8 cities across the globe dating from 2020 to explore the association between air pollution and health impacts. The data has been aggregated using real-world air quality and health data from multiple government sources.

# Key Questions:
Is there an association between AQI and hospital admissions?
Which air pollutant affects hospital admissions the most?
Does it vary across different cities?
Does it vart across different population density and spatial settings?
